## What is JobOps?

JobOps searches LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor and 10+ job boards from one screen, rewrites your CV for each role, scores your fit, checks visa sponsorship status, and tracks every application in one place.

It won't auto-submit behind your back. Recruiters can tell when applications are fully automated and it gets you blacklisted. Instead, **Auto-fill** opens the application page in a server-side browser, intelligently detects the form (DOM + a screenshot read by your configured vision model), and fills it from your profile — then hands it back to you to review and press Apply yourself. You get the speed without sacrificing quality.

## How It Works

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Search** | Scrapes 10+ job boards for roles matching your criteria |
| **Score** | AI ranks each job 0-100 against your profile |
| **Tailor** | Generates a rewritten CV matched to each job description |
| **Export** | Creates a polished PDF locally, or via [Reactive Resume](https://rxresu.me) |
| **Auto-fill** | Opens the application page, detects the form (vision + DOM), and fills it from your profile for you to review and submit |
| **Track** | Connects to Gmail and auto-detects interviews, offers, and rejections |

## Post-Application Tracking

Connect your Gmail and JobOps watches for recruiter replies automatically.

- *"We'd like to invite you to interview..."* → Status updates to **Interviewing**
- *"Unfortunately we won't be progressing..."* → Status updates to **Rejected**

No manual updates. No spreadsheets. See the [tracking docs](https://jobops.dakheera47.com/docs/features/post-application-tracking) for setup.
